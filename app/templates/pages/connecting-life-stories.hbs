                <p>We recently went on holiday with our new baby, and we forgot the babyphone at home. My wife insisted that we needed one, and we didn’t want to waste money buying a new babyphone. I decided to check out whether I could buy an app for that in my iPad, and I found 3 apps for it. One was free, but it really didn’t have the features I wanted. The 2nd was 2.99 euros, and the third was 5.99 euros. After comparing the features, I bought the one for 5.99 euros. Reflecting back, I might have only needed the one for 2.99 euros, but I was willing to spend more at that very moment because I felt I needed a feature-rich solution at the time, and I was willing to spend more money in the moment.</p>

                <p>I have some guests coming over this weekend, and they have a 5 year old child. I don’t usually watch TV at all, but my guests really insisted that I have some cartoon channels for their child only for this weekend. As I don’t watch TV (ever), I want to get TV services only for this weekend, and only for the 3 cartoon channels the 5 year old child will watch. I don’t want to be hassled with new contracts, new equipment, long customer service waits, or any cabling to make this happen. It should just work. I want to be able to activate and de-activate the services I need for this weekend all by myself in an easy to understand and simple manner.</p>

With some of our clients we only have a billing relation and have no interaction with, they seem not to be engaged in our fora, communities etc. We campaign a lot but cannot measure the real effectiveness, special amongst those groups.</p>

                <p>Each time we introduce additional functionality we need to align technical infrastructures, outsourced partner contributions and distributed environments. Even the smallest change needs still a lot of alignment. Our legacy world lows us down. We pay a vast amount of money to legacy invests that are often out of support. Our security risks are higher than before and we need to mitigate this to avoid bad press, claims and churn.</p>
