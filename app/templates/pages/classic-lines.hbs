These products enable faster speeds, improves the quality of communications, and permits the convergence of telecommunications services utilizing common enabling technology. While technology-savvy customers are eager to try out emergent technology, there exists a customer base for more traditional products. For instance, customers who prefer mobile devices that just make phone calls but have long battery lives are increasingly faced with fewer and fewer choices. In some cases, the need to migrate old technologies and consolidate it with newer technology leads to initial levels of poor service quality and unfamiliarity with the product, such as the case of migrating customers using voice with ISDN access to voice with IP access. Withdrawing older products with loyal customers can lead to losing them despite giving them newer alternatives based on advanced technology.');

Create virtual and physical spaces where users can share their passions about products with other users. Understand the situations where customers use these products, and their utility as communications enablers. When changing the underlying enabling technology to another, try and recreate the user experiences in forms that find a balance between the new technology and existing ways of work. Avoid excessive skeumorphic design in trying to preserve classics, such as preserving rotary dials on digital telephones [1], but also avoid radical new forms that depart from existing forms without providing sufficient  utility. If a classic product cannot be continued, migrate classic users by explaining how alternatives preserve the  key characteristics of these classics.');
