Each of these specifications cater to a particular number of possible states. For example, a product offered as a subscription can offered for different durations of 15 days, 1 month, 6 months, 1 year, or 2 years, resulting in 4 possible states for subscription duration. The subscription could be activated immediately, after a fixed duration (e.g. within 30 days), or on a specific date (e.g. 25 December), resulting in 3 possible states. Combinations of possible resulting states are treated in specific rules, for instance the requirement for activations of subscriptions less than 6 months to only be offered with immediate activations. For 4 possible durations, and 3 possible activations, we see 12 possible ways to consider durations and activations together. Once activated, the product could also be deactivated, where there could be 3 possible values for deactivation (immediate, after a fixed duration, or on a specific date). Once again specific rules can exist once again for deactivations, and now we have 36 possible ways to process durations, activations, and deactivations together. For example, if a product has been activated less than 10 days ago and it is for a duration of 6 months or less, it cannot be deactivated. The sequence in which rules are applied also needs to be considered. For example, it is not possible to deactivate a product if it has never been activated. With an increasing number of variables, the number of possible resulting states, how they need to be considered together, and the sequence in which they need to be considered only increases. Given the broad variety of possible states in product, service, infrastructure, and customer data, total number of possible combinations (when the sequence doesn’t matter) or permutations (when sequence matters) becomes a number in the several millions. In most contemporary Telcos, when products, services, and infrastructure are changed for customers, they are changed primarily using the customer’s current state, where all customers with the same current data are treated in the same way regardless of how they arrived in their current state. For example, a customer who has had a monthly subscription for 10 years with an operator (post-paid) who chooses to switch to a pay-as-you-go scheme (pre-paid) for temporary financial difficulties is henceforth treated exactly the same way as all other pre-paid customers disregarding their existing history with the operator. When they would like to switch back to being a post-paid customer, they are treated with the same criteria as a new customer. Using only their current state and using standardized specifications and rules for their current state, the potential of products, customers, services, and infrastructure is reduced to a few manageable states. Given the highly distributed nature of Telco processing systems, when the combinations or permutations of state unaddressed by those few managed states, the only option is to revert states a known stable configuration (“please restart your machine”). In addition, the storage of previous states, though technically possible, has been expensive given the high costs of processing and storage. With parallel processing architectures, high-speed storage (SSD drives), and large memory access, these historical reasons are increasingly fading away.<br /><br />Therefore record the history of changes for products, customers, services, and infrastructure using a small set of data and knowledge structures. Using an expression language that reflects this data and knowledge structure, compose any combination that is meaningful as a whole. Let people judge which combinations make sense and don’t rather than trying to transcribe this as computational logic. of a product, customer, service, or infrastructure, visibly show their history individually and in relation to other entities. Make this information easy to understand by people and by computational systems. It is preferable to record historic state through deltas in order to reduce waste in computational storage and processing. Finally, there will always be a minority that will exploit this flexibility with malicious or harmful intent, and guard against these exploits by creating complete visibility of who and how changes were made, the reasons they were made, and correlating interpreted data and knowledge to known malicious or harmful intent. Create the space for individuals to create their own combinations, and make deviations more visibly noticeable.<br /><br />Using a Language for Instances, store each individual change in products, customers, services, and infrastructure with the ability to process current and previous states while considering how to treat situations, making it possible to Adapt with Life. Make it possible for product, service, customer, and infrastructure to be Changeable by Many. Make user experiences in systems for the Few Skilled Gardeners to monitor deviations, and make deviations prominently visible. Create open Rhythmic Sensemaking Spaces where the Whole Town Participates within the Fortified Town, and secure Rhythmic Sensemaking Spaces for the Low-walled Town Communities.');
